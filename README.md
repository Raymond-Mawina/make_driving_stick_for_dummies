# make_driving_stick_for_dummies
  - I have been reading the book titled "Make it stick", most of the advice and wisdom in there actually works when it comes to making learning stick long term. I am using this small project to test how far I can stretch the wisdom.

  - Yes, I am re-inventing the wheel. I just want to create something I can use, that's all :) .

  - There is a lot manual labour that is going to go into this thing. Most of the work will be sourcing sign images and adding them to the codebase. Might need to move the images to AWS S3 when I put this on prod, yikes.

  - The next step is to prepare & upload more section images, around 500 of images, then add the sections to the website UI and partition the learning section into subsections. After all of this is done, then add the UI for user knowledge testing.
